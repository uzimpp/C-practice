# C practice

Time to go back to C!!.

These days, many trendy programming languages, such as JavaScript and Python, are taking over the industry. However, there are quite a large number of issues with them. Take JavaScript and Python as an example. For JS, it has memory management issue, high complexity, and the worst is `console.log(4 + '2');` and the output is 42? HOW?. And Python, it is just as slow as a python moving, unlike C, C++, and Rust.

C is just `segmentation fault` and `core dumped`.
